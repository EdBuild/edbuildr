Description: Import the 'EdBuild' master dataset of school district finance,
  student demographics, and community economic indicators for every school district in the United States.  
  The master dataset is built from the US Census, Annual Survey of School System Finances (F33)
  and joins data from the National Center for Education Statistics, Common Core of Data;
  the US Census, Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates; and the US Census,
  Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates. We apply 'EdBuild' standard processing to the
  dataset and provide the option to select from four different exclusion criteria - see the masterpull() help file for more details.
  The master dataset is available for any school year 2013-2017 or longitudinally for 2013-2017. 
  Additional functions in the package use 'EdBuild' master data to analyze the difference 
  between neighboring school districts and create formatted excel tables of school district data. For full details about
  'EdBuild' data processing please see 'EdBuild' (2019) <https://edbuild.org/content/dividing-lines/main/methodology>.
