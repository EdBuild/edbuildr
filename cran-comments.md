## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have: 
* added undirected single quotes around 'EdBuild' and 'EdBuild's' in the description file
* added a reference describing the methods in the package in the description field of the description file
* replaced \dontrun{} with \donttest{} for examples that take more than 5 seconds to execute 
* added \value to all .Rd files and explained the function's results

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new submission.

There was a message about possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION: ("EdBuild" at 15:60 and "EdBuild's" at 10:21 and 18:43).
* Those words are spelled correctly.
